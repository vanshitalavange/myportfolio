        <p>
          Most of you reading this blog might assume that this is a technical
          blog, well it’s not a technical blog but a small attempt to relate
          this technical principle(input -> processing -> output) of programming
          to real life. People often tend to start a new thing, they continue it
          for some time, and when they don’t see quick results, they stop. Then
          one starts believing that massive success requires massive action.
        </p>
        <h1 style="text-align: left">
          Does the improvement made should always be remarkable?
        </h1>
        <p>
          Small improvements are often not noticeable but they can help you in
          the long run. When you get a little better each day, it all adds up
          and gives you remarkable results in the end. Conversely, if you waste
          your time thinking that making such tiny improvements won’t yield any
          results then you would not see yourself getting even 1% better because
          all your time was wasted in underestimating the power of tiny
          improvements.
        </p>

        <h1 style="text-align: left">Input → Processing → Output</h1>
        <p>
          In programming terms, when input is given, it gets processed and then
          you receive the output. So how can we relate this principle to our
          life? The answer is simple when you give in to a certain thing, this
          input of yours gets processed and it gives you results i.e the output.
          But the only difference here between applying this principle to
          programming and real life is that in real life your input won’t get
          processed as fast as it gets in programming. Remember that the most
          powerful outcomes of any process are delayed. So one needs to be
          patient and should not stop giving inputs just because the processing
          part is taking time. People often consider setting goals as their
          priority but they should focus on improving the processes that are
          going to lead to the results. When you look at the problem with a view
          that you need to get results you just try to fix it temporarily, this
          results in no improvement but when you try to figure out each aspect
          that can cause the problem and try to improve the processes that can
          lead to getting better results then that adds value to your life.
