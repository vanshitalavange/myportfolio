          Just by reading the topic of this blog, some of you might assume that
          it is boring but hold on...Logistics is <strong>NOT</strong> boring.
          Have you ever wondered if the logistics chain was not there then how
          would you receive all sorts of products at your doorstep? Logistics is
          everywhere, we have e-commerce logistics, hyperlocal logistics,
          logistics in agriculture, seafood logistics, petroleum logistics, etc.
          Logistics is vital to the economy, it is one of the fastest-growing
          career fields in the world.
        </p>
        <h1 style="text-align: left">Logistics in layman’s terms</h1>
        <p>
          Let’s understand logistics with an example. Consider you placed an
          order online for any item, after 3-4 days or depending upon the
          company's delivery time you receive the order. But have you ever
          wondered what happens behind the scenes to fulfill your order? <br/></br>The
          chain given below describes the movement of your product i.e from the
          supplier to the end consumer.<br/></br> Inventory management → warehousing →
          packaging → labeling → billing → Shipping → payment collection →
          return → exchange</br></br> By looking at the chain, we can say that managing
          logistics is indeed a complex operation. Logistics is a process of
          managing how the resources are obtained, stored, and transported to
          the final destination.
        </p>
        <h1 style="text-align: left">Is Logistics and Supply chain management (SCM) the same?</h1>
        <p>Some people say that there is no difference between the two terms. To clear this doubt, logistics is all about the <strong>7 R's</strong> i.e Getting the right product, in the right quantity, in the right condition, at the right place, at the right time, delivering it to the right customer, at the right price. Whereas supply chain management is the planning and management of 4 activities :

        <ul>
          <li>  Procurement - arranging raw materials for production</li>
           <li> Sourcing -  selecting the right suppliers of the raw materials that we need for production</li>
            <li>Conversion - converting raw materials into finished goods</li>
            <li>Logistics management - management of (inventory + warehousing + packaging +labelling + billing + shipping+ payment collection + return + exchange)</li>
          </ul>  
            By understanding SCM and logistics, we can conclude that SCM is a broader domain and logistics is a part of this domain. Another key difference is that SCM focuses on competitive advantage whereas logistics focuses on customer satisfaction.
        </br></br>
            <strong>With logistics being a complex chain, it often faces certain challenges. Let’s understand one of the major challenges in logistics management.</strong>
            </p>
        <h1 style="text-align: left">How is the lack of end-to-end visibility affecting the chain?
        </h1>
        <p><strong>Visibility</strong> refers to the ability to track and trace different products in transit, giving a clear view of the inventory and activity. Challenges that arise due to lack of end-to-end visibility include poor planning and execution, inefficiencies in organizing, processing, and managing data, inability to predict and prepare for risks, and inconsistencies in the flow of data between stakeholders. Planning delivery routes and assigning tasks to delivery executives without having visibility of performance history results in financial losses.
        </p>
        <h1 style="text-align: left">Benefits of attaining end-to-end visibility
        </h1>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduced risks -  if we know where potential disruptions can arise, the chances of them causing problems can be reduced.
                </li>
                 <li>Increased efficiency - when it comes to making data-backed decisions, you don’t have to think twice or wait for your next move. This increases efficiency and speed.
                </li>
                  <li>Fulfilling customer demands - Predicting future demands based on historical data becomes easy, thus meeting the customer demands.
                </li>
               
        </p>
        <p>To conclude, logistics is an important element of the supply chain that contributes to reducing costs and improving efficiency. At the same time, it provides customer satisfaction.
